## 🎯 Documentation Philosophy

- **Architecture-First**: Documentation follows the same structure as the codebase
- **Living Documentation**: Kept up-to-date with code changes
- **Developer-Friendly**: Clear examples and usage patterns
- **Decision Records**: Important architectural decisions documented

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **New to the project?** Start with `modules/` to understand features
2. **Working on UI?** Check `ui/shared/` for component patterns
3. **Adding business logic?** Review `domain/` and `services/`
4. **Managing state?** See `contexts/` for app-wide state management
