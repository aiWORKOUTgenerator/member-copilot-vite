# ðŸ’¡ Workout Path Selection Page Feature Request

## Overview

**Title**: Workout Path Selection Page - Card-Based Interface
**Requester**: Development Team
**Date**: 2025-01-27
**Priority**: High
**Target Sprint**: Current Sprint

## Description

### Problem Statement

The current workout generation flow uses a simple toggle between "Quick Workout Setup" and "Detailed Workout Setup" that doesn't provide enough context for users to make an informed decision. Users need a clearer understanding of what each path offers before committing to a specific workflow.

### Proposed Solution

Replace the current toggle interface with a dedicated "Choose Your Workout Path" page featuring two prominent cards that clearly explain the differences between Quick and Detailed workout setup options. This page will serve as an entry point that helps users understand the trade-offs and choose the most appropriate path for their needs.

### User Story

**As a** user wanting to generate a workout
**I want to** see clear explanations of the Quick vs Detailed workout setup options
**So that** I can make an informed decision about which path best suits my needs and time constraints

## Technical Specification

### Architecture Changes

- Create new page structure for workout path selection
- Implement card-based selection interface
- Update routing to support new page flow
- Separate path selection from actual generation forms

### API Changes

```typescript
// New route structure
/dashboard/koorstuw /
  generate / // Path selection page
  dashboard /
  workouts /
  generate /
  quick / // Quick workout form
  dashboard /
  workouts /
  generate /
  detailed; // Detailed workout form

// New component interfaces
interface WorkoutPathCardProps {
  title: string;
  description: string;
  features: string[];
  difficulty: 'Beginner' | 'Advanced';
  icon: React.ComponentType<{ className?: string }>;
  colorScheme: 'quick' | 'detailed';
  onClick: () => void;
}

interface WorkoutPathSelectionProps {
  onPathSelect: (path: 'quick' | 'detailed') => void;
}
```

### UI Changes

- [ ] WorkoutPathSelectionPage - Main page component
- [ ] WorkoutPathCard - Individual path selection card
- [ ] WorkoutPathCardList - Container for card layout
- [ ] WorkoutPathSelectionContainer - State management container
- [ ] Updated routing configuration

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation & Structure

### Phase 2: Core Implementation

- [ ] Implement WorkoutPathSelectionPage
- [ ] Create WorkoutPathSelectionContainer with state management
- [ ] Add navigation logic between selection and generation pages
- [ ] Implement analytics tracking for path selection

### Phase 3: Polish & Testing

- [ ] Add comprehensive styling and animations
- [ ] Implement responsive design for mobile devices
- [ ] Add accessibility features (keyboard navigation, screen readers)
- [ ] Create integration tests for the new flow

## Directory Structure

â”‚       â””â”€â”€ types.ts
â””â”€â”€ hooks/
    â”œâ”€â”€ useWorkoutPathSelection.ts          # NEW: Path selection logic
    â””â”€â”€ useWorkoutGeneration.ts             # NEW: Generation logic
```

## Component Architecture

### Atomic Components

**WorkoutPathCard.tsx**

- Reusable card component for path selection
- Handles individual card styling and interactions
- Supports different color schemes and icons

### Molecular Components

**WorkoutPathCardList.tsx**

- Manages layout and spacing of multiple cards
- Handles responsive grid layout
- Coordinates card interactions

### Organism Components

**WorkoutPathSelectionContainer.tsx**

- Manages state and navigation logic
- Handles analytics tracking
- Coordinates between selection and generation flows

### Page Components

**WorkoutPathSelectionPage.tsx**

- Main page component with layout and routing
- Handles page-level concerns (title, meta, etc.)

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Users can clearly understand the difference between Quick and Detailed paths
- [ ] Path selection is intuitive and visually appealing
- [ ] Navigation between selection and generation pages is seamless
- [ ] Analytics tracking captures user path selection behavior
- [ ] Mobile experience is optimized and responsive
- [ ] Accessibility requirements are met (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- [ ] No regression in existing workout generation functionality

## Dependencies

- Existing workout generation components and logic
- Current routing system and navigation patterns
- Analytics tracking infrastructure
- Design system components (cards, buttons, icons)

## Risk Assessment

### Identified Risks

- **User Flow Disruption**: Changing the entry point might confuse existing users
- **Mobile Layout**: Card-based design might not work well on small screens
- **Performance**: Additional page load might impact perceived performance

### Mitigation Strategies

- **Gradual Rollout**: Implement feature flag for gradual user adoption
- **Responsive Design**: Thorough mobile testing and optimization
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track page load times and optimize as needed

## Analytics Requirements

### Events to Track

- `workout_path_page_viewed` - When user lands on selection page
- `workout_path_selected` - When user chooses a path (with path type)
- `workout_path_selection_time` - Time spent on selection page
- `workout_path_navigation` - Navigation patterns between pages

### Metrics to Monitor

- Path selection conversion rate
- Time spent on selection page
- Mobile vs desktop usage patterns
- User feedback and satisfaction scores

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions

- **Path Recommendations**: Suggest path based on user history
- **Feature Comparison**: Side-by-side feature comparison table
- **User Preferences**: Remember user's preferred path
- **A/B Testing**: Test different card designs and messaging

### Scalability Considerations

- Support for additional workout paths in the future
- Internationalization support for different languages
- Customizable card content based on user segments
- Integration with user onboarding flows
