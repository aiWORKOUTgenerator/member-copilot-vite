# Quality Assurance Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for maintaining code quality and preventing issues before they reach production.

## üìã Documentation Overview

### [Pre-PR Verification System](./pre-pr-verification-system.md)

**Comprehensive guide** for implementing a complete pre-PR verification system that catches issues before they reach GitHub.

- **Current State Analysis**: What we have vs. what we need
- **Implementation Phases**: 3-phase rollout plan
- **CI/CD Integration**: GitHub Actions workflows
- **Success Metrics**: Measurable goals for each phase
- **Maintenance Guide**: Ongoing tasks and monitoring

### [Phase 1 Implementation Guide](./phase-1-implementation-guide.md)

**Quick start guide** for implementing the critical foundation in 3 hours.

- **Step-by-step instructions** with copy-paste commands
- **Verification steps** to ensure everything works
- **Troubleshooting** for common issues
- **Expected results** after implementation

### [Phase 2 Implementation Guide](./phase-2-implementation-guide.md)

**Testing foundation guide** for implementing comprehensive testing in 3-4 days.

- **Unit and integration tests** for critical components
- **Test coverage enforcement** with 80%+ thresholds
- **Mock factories and utilities** for consistent testing
- **Integration with verify scripts** for automated testing

## üéØ Current Status

### ‚úÖ What's Working

- **ESLint** with TypeScript, React, and accessibility rules (54 warnings, 0 errors)
- **TypeScript** strict configuration with modern patterns
- **Prettier** for consistent code formatting
- **Husky hooks** with lint-staged and commitlint
- **Vitest** test framework with coverage thresholds
- **Build process** with Vite
- **Commit message linting** with conventional commits

### ‚ö†Ô∏è What Needs Improvement

- **Test coverage** enforcement (thresholds set but no tests yet)
- **Unit and integration tests** (basic setup complete)
- **E2E testing** (not implemented)
- **Performance monitoring** (not implemented)
- **Accessibility warnings** (54 warnings to address in future)

### üö® Recent Issues That Would Be Caught

- ‚úÖ **TypeScript interval type errors** (ESLint + TypeScript)
- ‚úÖ **Build failures** (build verification)
- ‚úÖ **Code formatting issues** (Prettier)
- ‚úÖ **Commit message format** (commitlint)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Context-to-hooks migration issues** (needs more tests)
- ‚ùå **Runtime errors** (needs E2E tests)

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Immediate Action (30 minutes)

```bash
# Follow the Phase 1 Implementation Guide
# This will add Prettier, test setup, and verify scripts
```

### Next Sprint (2-3 days)

```bash
# Follow the Phase 2 Implementation Guide
# This will add comprehensive testing and 80%+ coverage
```

### Future Sprints

```bash
# Add E2E testing with Playwright
# Implement accessibility and performance checks
```

## üìä Success Metrics

### Phase 1 Goals

- [ ] 100% of TypeScript errors caught before PR
- [ ] Consistent code formatting across codebase
- [ ] 80% test coverage on critical components
- [ ] Zero build failures in CI

### Phase 2 Goals

- [ ] 90% test coverage overall
- [ ] All critical user flows covered by tests
- [ ] Integration tests for context-to-hooks migration

### Phase 3 Goals

- [ ] E2E tests for critical user journeys
- [ ] Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- [ ] Performance budgets met
- [ ] Zero security vulnerabilities

## üîß Tools & Scripts

### Available Commands

```bash
npm run lint          # ESLint checking
npm run build         # TypeScript + Vite build
npm run test:run      # Run tests (when implemented)
npm run verify        # Full verification (when implemented)
npm run verify:quick  # Quick verification (when implemented)
```

### Husky Hooks

- **pre-commit**: Lint + format check
- **pre-push**: Full verification
