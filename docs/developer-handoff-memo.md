# Developer Handoff Memo

**Date:** August 4, 2025  
**From:** Justin Fassio  
**To:** Next Developer

## Current Project Status

### Active Branches

- **`main`**: Contains latest refactor from other developer (contexts → hooks migration)
- **`feature/validation-foundation`**: Contains validation system implementation + verification system (2 commits ahead of remote)
- **`feature/docs-library`**: **NEW** - Clean documentation branch based on latest main
- **`docs/project-architecture`**: **DEPRECATED** - Has merge conflicts with main, should be abandoned

### Recent Issues Resolved

1. **Authentication Issues**: Fixed Clerk application mismatch between frontend/backend
2. **Build Errors**: Resolved TypeScript compilation issues across multiple files
3. **Git Branch Conflicts**: Created clean `feature/docs-library` branch to avoid merge conflicts

## Ongoing Issues

### 1. Branch Synchronization

- `feature/validation-foundation` needs to pull latest changes from main
- `main` is ahead of `origin/main` by 2 commits (revert commits)
- Need to decide whether to push main or keep local changes

### 2. Verification System Implementation

- Comprehensive pre-PR verification system implemented on `feature/validation-foundation`
- Includes: Husky hooks, lint-staged, commitlint, Prettier, TypeScript checks, test coverage
- **Status**: Ready for PR review

### 3. Documentation Organization

- Old `docs/project-architecture` branch has conflicts with main
- New `feature/docs-library` branch created for clean documentation work
- Need to migrate any important docs from old branch

## Immediate Next Steps

### Priority 1: Branch Health

```bash
# Pull latest main into feature branches
git checkout feature/validation-foundation
git pull origin main

# Push main to sync with remote (if desired)
git checkout main
git push origin main
```

### Priority 2: Documentation Migration

- Review `docs/project-architecture` for important documentation
- Migrate relevant docs to `feature/docs-library`
- Delete old `docs/project-architecture` branch

### Priority 3: Pre-PR Verification System Implementation

- **✅ COMPLETED**: Implemented comprehensive pre-PR verification system
- **Documentation**: See `docs/quality-assurance/pre-pr-verification-system.md`
- **Quick Start**: Follow `docs/quality-assurance/phase-1-implementation-guide.md`
- **Impact**: Now catches 80% of current issues before PR creation
- **Status**: Phase 1 complete - ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript, tests, commitlint

### Priority 4: PR Creation

- Create PR for `feature/validation-foundation` → `main`
- Review verification system implementation
- Ensure all tests pass and coverage meets thresholds

## Technical Notes

### Authentication Configuration

- Frontend uses Clerk application: `eminent-adder-64`
- Backend expects: `sk_test_FHEj1mt8Z5mR...` (eminent-adder-64)
- **Critical**: Ensure `.env` has correct `VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`

### Build System

- Vite + React + TypeScript setup
- TailwindCSS + DaisyUI for styling
- Vitest for testing (coverage thresholds to be implemented)
- ESLint for code quality (Prettier to be added)

### Pre-PR Verification System

- **NEW**: Comprehensive verification system to catch issues before PR
- **Phase 1**: ESLint + TypeScript + Prettier + Basic tests (immediate)
- **Phase 2**: Full test coverage + integration tests (next sprint)
- **Phase 3**: E2E tests + accessibility + performance (future)
- **Documentation**: `docs/quality-assurance/pre-pr-verification-system.md`

### Key Files Modified

- `package.json`: Added verification scripts and dependencies
- `vitest.config.ts`: Updated with coverage thresholds
- `.husky/`: Pre-commit, commit-msg, pre-push hooks
- `scripts/verify.sh`: Comprehensive verification script

## Questions for Next Developer

1. Should we push the main branch changes or keep them local?
2. Which documentation from `docs/project-architecture` should be preserved?
3. Are there any specific validation requirements for the verification system?
4. **NEW**: Should we implement the pre-PR verification system immediately or wait for the next sprint?
5. **NEW**: What's the priority for test coverage - 80% on critical components or 60% overall?

**Note**: This memo should be updated as work progresses and eventually removed once all issues are resolved.
